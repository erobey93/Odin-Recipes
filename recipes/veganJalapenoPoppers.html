    <p>These savory jalapeño poppers are a great plant-based party or game day appetizer. Diced mushrooms add a "meaty" addition with the absence of bacon, and vegan cheese substitutes keep this appetizer vegan.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            12 medium jalapeno peppers, sliced in half and seeded</li>

         <li>   1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

        <li>    1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, finely diced </li>

         <li>   ½ cup finely diced onion </li>

        <li>    2 cloves garlic, minced </li>

         <li>   1 (8 ounce) tub vegan cream cheese substitute, softened </li>

         <li>   1 cup vegan shredded cheese substitute, divided</li>

         <li>   salt and ground black pepper to taste
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Set jalapeño halves on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, open side up.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic to the skillet and saute until vegetables are tender and mushrooms have released their liquid, about 8 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a paper towel-lined plate to soak up the excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Mix mushroom mixture, cream cheese substitute, 3/4 cup shredded cheese substitute, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spoon into the jalapeño pepper halves on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and top with the remaining 1/4 shredded cheese substitute. Broil until the cheese is melted and slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
