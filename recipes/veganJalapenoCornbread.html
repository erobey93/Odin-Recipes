    <p>Tasty, spicy, rich cornbread that is vegan, and done in the air fryer! Please be aware that different brands and sizes may yield different results. You will need an air fryer that accommodates adding a 6-inch inner pot.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon flaxseed meal</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>

         <li>   cooking spray</li>

          <li>  1 cup stone-ground yellow cornmeal </li>

          <li>  ⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>

         <li>   ¼ cup nutritional yeast</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon flaxseed meal</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water and flaxseed meal in a small bowl and set aside for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>
         <li>   Meanwhile, preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray a 6-inch heat-proof inner pot with cooking spray.</li>
          <li>  Combine cornmeal, flour, nutritional yeast, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a medium mixing bowl. Add the flaxseed and water mixture, almond milk, and oil; stir until it just comes together with no lumps. Stir in jalapeno and pour into the prepared pot; place into the air fryer.</li>

         <li>   Cook in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes. Remove the inner pot carefully with tongs, flip the cornbread, and continue to air fry until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 5 minutes more. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
